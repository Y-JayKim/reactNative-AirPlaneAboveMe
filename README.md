# Airplane Above Me

Have you ever wondered about the airplane flying over you? How high is it, and what kind of aircraft is it? Wonder no more. 
Airplane Above Me is a game that gives you that information, along with an opportunity to collect them.

If you want to try it out, the link to the Expo project is [here.](https://expo.io/@bordt/AirplaneAboveMe)
